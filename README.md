# JavaScript - Candidate Test

Please create a web app with at least 3 views: a "list of items", an
"edit item", and a "add new item" view.
All forms should have basic validation and the app should be bug-free
and functional.

The user should be able to:
• View a list of existing items
• Add a new item
• Delete an item
• Edit an item (please make more than 1 editable field)
• Sort and filter the list of items a couple different ways

Note:
Please only use vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks, libraries etc (no
React, jQuery, and so on). You may use libraries/frameworks for CSS
(e.g. Bootstrap).
ES5 instead of ES6, or include polyfills necessary to support IE11.
